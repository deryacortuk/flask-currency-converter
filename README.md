Requests: HTTP for Humans

Requests allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. 
There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data.
Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to urllib3.

REST is useful and helps map out how we might want to interact with a web based API, it’s sometimes used for things 
that don’t really fit well.There are lots of cases where what we want to do is perform some work or take an action directly.
